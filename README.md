## Google Data Analytics Capstone Project : Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Using R
In this project, I am working as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
